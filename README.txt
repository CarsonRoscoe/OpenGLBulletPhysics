Simulation One:
- Ball that drops and bounces on floor, bouncing at a lower height every time until eventually stopping

Simulation Two:
- Ball that drops onto a ramp (who's angle can be controller), rolls down the ramp (OpenGL visually rolling) and lands in a box.

Controls:
-Single Tap to start simulation
-Double Tap to reset simulation
-Triple Tap to swap simulations (Switch between Simulation One and Simulation Two)
-Swipe Up to raise ramp angle by five degrees (Simulation Two Only)
-Swipe Down to lower ramp angle by five degrees (Simulation Two Only)
